Play the game(s) first before reading this post. It will be worth it.</p>
<p>The Last Of Us left a deep imprint on me since I finished it in late 2018. I never expected a video game to have such an impact on me. What started as a purchase to have some fun on my new 4K TV turned into an experience that I will forever hold dearly. The Last Of Us made me realize that interactive media (video games) is an entirely new art form which is wholly unique and revolutionary. TV's are great, but fundamentally they're not much different from theater, which existed for thousands of years. I will perhaps dive deeper into this idea at a later date, but let's get back to The Last Of Us Part 2.</p>
<p>The Last Of Us Part 2 has been extermely controversial to say the least. This post is not about that. This post is a personal examination of the game. In other words, I would've wrote this post anyway if there weren't so many controversies and debates surrounding this game. This post does not serve to convince anyone but maybe myself, it helps to untangle some of the aspects of this game that left me thinking and pondering for days. Therefore, I will not go over aspects of the game that I feel is fairly straightforward, thematically and storytelling wise (Joel's death for example).</p>
<h2>Abby</h2>
<p>To me, Abby is the most <em>relatable</em> character in the game. Sounds strange, but I feel that on some level, this is Naughty Dog's intention. Many of Abby's story arcs are mirrored in characters we already know and love, namely Joel and Ellie. Her dad's death and her taking Lev under her care and protection is mirrored by Joel's, namely Sarah's death and taking Ellie under his wing. Abby's need for revenge, and subsequently letting go of revenge is mirrored by Ellie's need for revenge and letting go of revenge.</p>
<p>More importantly, Abby is relatable to the player, me. Through Joel and Ellie, I <em>felt</em> their emotional beats. I am completely <em>in sync</em> with them, feeling for them at a very deep level. The same can't be said for Abby. By the time I started playing Abby during Seattle Day 1, I'd have played and bonded with Joel and Ellie for over 25 hours (Original game + Left Behind + First half). Plus, much more importantly, I had to play Abby after her having done something truly horrific. There was no way that playing Abby for 12 hours will make me love her as much as I loved Ellie and Joel.</p>
<p>But I don't think that's what needs to be achieved here.</p>
<p>In order for this to work, I just need to <em>understand</em> and <em>empathize</em> with Abby. Mind you, this cannot be achieved with just a few flasback sequences and a few minutes of gameplay. I needed to really step into her shoes, see all the difficult, selfless decisions she has to make, and truly feel her pain and frustration. In other words, Naughty Dog's job here is to <em>humanize</em> Abby. And I think they've done a fantastic job at that. By the end of the 12 hours, I feel that I <em>relate</em> to Abby.</p>
<p>12 hours ago, Abby was this monster that caught up to me (Ellie) in the theather. Now, back at the theater, I feel like Joel's ghost. Heartbroken and wish this would just end.</p>
<p>But Naughty Dog wanted more...</p>
<h2>The Ending(s)</h2>
<p>To me, any satisfying (a loaded term) ending must involve either both Ellie and Abby dying, or both of them living. If Abby bested Ellie, it would've pissed me off to no end as Ellie lost everything and a character that I didn't <strong>love</strong> gained <em>some</em> upper hand. Sure, it can still be <em>grounded</em> storytelling, but I don't think it's a satisfying one. If Ellie bested Abby, Ellie still lost everything, including her humanity. She, as a character, is just a husk at this point. Broken and irredeemable. Both of them dying would've been depressing, but it can still be a (storytelling wise) <em>satisfying</em> end.</p>
<p>Back to the theater fight.</p>
<p>I think Naughty Dog could've ended it there, by either killing both of them off, or by having a more intense and fair fight where both Ellie and Abby decide to let their vengeance go. Then, we can end it off in the farm house with Ellie having a happy life with Dina and J.J. I think I would've been perfectly happy with that ending, but only if the fair fight happened and both characters decide to let their vengeance go.</p>
<p>But there's a reason I'm not a writer. Me being personally happy with this doesn't make it a good ending. I think thematically wise, this probably would've been too happy of an ending for such a dark and depressing game. The story needed something more... powerful.</p>
<p>And Naughty Dog took the risk tell that more powerful story.</p>
<p>Ellie needed that final story arc, one final decision. She needed to lose everything she has left (Dina and J.J) to go after Abby. But in the final encounter, she decides to let Abby go and gets to keep her humanity as a result. Ellie comes back to an empty house, without her 2 fingers to play the guitar. She lost her family, and she lost her last physical connection to Joel. But, she left her humanity intact. She now has the opportunity to start a new life.</p>
<p>To me, the ending was depressing, yet hopeful at the same time. The conflicting emotions I feel is so much more powerful than if it ended with Ellie living happily ever after in the farm. In some ways, it's a bittersweet ending. It also makes me care so much more for Ellie, leaving me wondering where does Ellie go next, what decisions she will make, who will she encounter in her journey.</p>
<h2>The Violence</h2>
<p>Personally, I find this aspect a little hard to grapple with. The game's theme strongly revolves around the cycle of violence. Every character has a back story, further emphasized by the fact that enemies have names, even for their dogs. In this respect, it's even more difficult to justify the violence that the characters inflict. Naughty Dog tries to make this more believable by 1) Making the environment inherently violent (all trespassers are shot on sight) 2) Making the character (esp. Ellie) 'blind' to the violence due to their own justifications. 3) Making the enemies comically evil (Slave labor, forced marriage in a religious cult).</p>
<p>Personally, I find this the least grounded aspect of The Last Of Us. I feel it's somewhat explainable for Ellie's rampage throughout Seattle and Santa Barbara, as she was blinded by hate. It's more difficult to justify it for Abby's, Lev's and Yara's case though. Lev clearly has attachment to his family and community, I don't think it's believable for him to be entirely ok with rampaging throughout the island to get to a boat. And it severely weakens Abby's character for her to do the same rampaging just to get to Lev. It's believable for Joel to do that because he's set up as a morally bankrupt man at the very beginning, Abby was not. In fact, she believed in the Fireflies and bringing good to humanity.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game doesn't show what the impact of these senseless violence have on the characters, and what they learned from it.</p>
<p>Sure, I get it. The game focuses on the impact of violence intimately on Ellie and Abby. But I think the overarching theme is so strong and in your face that it needs to be addressed one way or another.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having watched interviews and documentaries with the creators and actors of The Last Of Us, I was never worried even for one second that the sequel will be bad. And I was right. The Last Of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece, and I mean it in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Having played the second game, now I view the first game as merely an exploration of what interactive media can do. It plays out much more like a movie than a game. Of course, being a game spanning 15 hours made it a very unique experience. But ultimately, it's a <em>story</em> about characters.</p>
<p>The second game is an unapologetic showcase of what is only possible in interactive media. The story is no longer only about the characters, but also you, the player. The game is as much about Ellie's thirst for revenge, as it is about <strong><em>your</em></strong> thirst for revenge, after having killied off <strong><em>your</em></strong> beloved character. The game is about <strong><em>you</em></strong> understanding and empathizing with Abby. The game is masterfully designed to either make you feel completely in sync with the characters (Ellie's sadness and thirst for revenge for Joel's death) or dissonant (Ellie's torture of Nora, Abby's beating down of Ellie, Ellie's beating down of Abby). In that sense, <strong><em>you</em></strong>, whether you realize it or not, are a character of this game.</p>
<p>This sick, beautiful game that Naughty Dog has created.</p>
