Thus, this is less applicable to Wayland. My experience also mostly revolves around GNOME, and this will cover things that are specific to GNOME as well.</p>\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n<p>If you have a dual 4k monitor and have a screen rotated to portrait mode, and want a fractional scaling of 1.5, this script may be useful to you:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 2\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides \"{'Gdk/WindowScalingFactor': &#x3C;2>}\"\n\nxrandr \\\n  --output DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE --primary --mode 3840x2160 --fb 9000x5760 --rotate normal  --scale 1.5x1.5 --panning 5760x3240+0+0 \\\n  --output DP-0-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE --mode 3840x2160 --fb 9000x5760 --right-of DP-4 --scale 1.5x1.5 --panning 3240x5760+5760+0 --rotate right\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>GNOME 3.32 (Since Ubuntu 19.04) introduced fractional scaling. I have been happily using it but it broke in Ubuntu 20.04 for NVIDIA cards and <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mutter/+bug/1873403\">a fix is not in the horizon</a>. (What's new, really...)</p>\n<p>So, let's go back to how we do fractional scaling pre-3.32: via xrandr scaling hacks. I believe the implementation of fractional scaling in GNOME 3.32 uses a similar technique, but I've not followed the development closely to say for sure.</p>\n<p>Scaling calculation is a bit tricky because we have to deal with GNOME scaling + xrandr scaling.</p>\n<h1>Main Idea</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>We scale everything to 200% in GNOME.</li>\n<li>We then up-res everything to 200% of the PERCEIVED resolution that we want (more on that later)</li>\n<li>We then scale everything back down to the PHYSICAL resolution of our monitors, this time via xrandr.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is actually a pretty common approach. <a href=\"https://medium.com/elementaryos/top-3-misconceptions-about-hidpi-f5ef493d7bf8\">Apple does a similar strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that we're optimizing for display quality here, this might be a problem if your hardware is not powerful enough. You might need to tweak the calculations to avoid integer scaling of 200%.</p>\n<h2>Terminology - or how to think about stuff</h2>\n<p>I like to categorize resolutions to 3 types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Physical Resolution\nThis is the actual resolution of your monitor.</li>\n<li>Virtual Resolution\nThis is the resolution that your graphics card/OS actually renders. For example, you can render with a virtual resolution of <code>3840x2160</code> (4k) and display it onto your monitor with only <code>1920x1080</code> (physical resolution) pixels. Or vice versa.</li>\n<li>Perceived Resolution\nThis is the trickiest one. I sometimes like to think of this as IMAGINARY resolution. This is the resolution that you <strong><em>perceive</em></strong> given how the size of the UI looks to you.<br>\n<br>\nFor example, if you have a <code>3840x2160</code> monitor and you are also rendering at <code>3840x2160</code> (physical resolution == virtual resolution), and you set a scaling factor of 2, the UI will look 2x bigger. More importantly, the size of the UI <strong>will be the same as on a 1920x1080 monitor rendering at 1920x1080</strong>. In other words, on a <code>3840x2160</code> monitor with a scaling factor of 2, the <strong><em>perceived resolution</em></strong> is <code>1920x1080</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, let's move on to explanations for each step.</p>\n<h2>1 - Scale Everything to 200% in GNOME.</h2>\n<p>The important point in here is that we scale everything just to the step where things look too large. If 200% is still too small, you'll need to scale to 300% etc and adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p>After doing this, our resolutions are:<br>\nPhysical: <code>3840x2160</code> (never changes)<br>\nVirtual : <code>3840x2160</code><br>\nPerceived: <strong><code>1920x1080</code></strong></p>\n<h2>2 - Calculate our desired perceived resolution, up-res it 2x to get our virtual resolution</h2>\n<p>1920x1080 is too low of a resolution (remember, we're working with perceived resolution here). So think, with your monitor size, what <em>native</em> resolution will look good on it? For example, 2560x1440 is a popular choice for 27\" monitor.</p>\n<p><code>2560 / 1920 = 1.333...</code>. You can certainly use a ratio of <code>1.3333</code>, but to make our calculations simpler, let's settle for a ratio of 1.5. Thus, <code>1920 * 1.5 = 2880</code> and <code>1080 * 1.5 = 1620</code>. (Note: If you have a GNOME scaling factor of 2, this calculation is enough. But if you have a different scale factor, then you'll need to make sure the factor you choose can 'scale back' to the physical resolution).</p>\n<p>Our goal now is to make our monitor look like it has a resolution of <code>2880x1620</code> (i.e. perceived resolution), but with the <em>fidelity</em> and <em>crispness</em> of a 4k display. To preserve the crispness, we will increase the number of pixels (in each direction) we render by 2x, i.e. <code>5760x3240</code></p>\n<p>Thus, our calculated resolutions should be:<br>\nPhysical: <code>3840x2160</code> (never changes)<br>\nVirtual : <strong><code>5760x3240</code></strong><br>\nPerceived: <strong><code>2880x1620</code></strong></p>\n<p>***Small Note:*** This means that even though we're only using a 4k monitor, we're actually rendering more resolution than if we had a 5k (<code>5120x2880</code>) monitor! It's advantageous to have a monitor where its resolution is just doubled (per-side) of its usual (non-scaled) comfortable native resolution for you.<br>\ne.g. if <code>2560x1440</code> without scaling looks good on a 27\" monitor for you, the best 'high dpi' resolution will be <code>5120x2880</code>. If <code>1920x1080</code> looks good on a 24\" monitor for you, then <code>3840x2160</code> (4k) is the best.<br>\nIn this case, it also means we don't have to spend computer resources to scale the resolution back down to the physical resolution.</p>\n<h2>3 - Scale Everything Back to The Physical Resolution</h2>\n<p>To set the <code>--scale</code> property in <code>xrandr</code> correctly, we need to figure out how to scale our <strong>virtual</strong> resolution back into our <strong>physical</strong> resolution. Since we've already done our math above, it's just a matter of dividing: <code>virtual / physical</code>. e.g. <code>5760 / 3840 = 1.5</code></p>\n<p>Thus, our scale factor is <code>1.5</code>. In fact, if we chose a GNOME scaling factor of 2, then our scale factor will always be the same as the ratio we chose above because... math.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let gnome_scale_factor = 2; // This may change, depending on user.\nlet up_res_factor = 2; // This is constant. 2x is almost always enough for crisp images.\n\n\nlet virtual_res =  (physical_res / gnome_scale_factor) * scale_ratio  * up_res_factor;\nlet xrandr_scale_factor = virtual_res / physical_res;\n\nassert_eq!(virtual_res, physical_res * scale_ratio);\nassert_eq!(virtual_res / physical_res, scale_ratio);\nassert_eq!(xrandr_scale_factor, scale_ratio);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can't count on it if we have a different scaling factor though.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>xrandr</code>'s concept of 'scale' is inverse of GNOME's concept of scale! <code>xrandr</code> scales <strong><em>resolution</em></strong> <strong>down</strong> (e.g. <code>5760 / 1.5 = 3840</code>) while GNOME scales <strong><em>UI elements</em></strong> <strong>up</strong> (i.e. icons will look 2x bigger). It may be tempting to think of GNOME scaling as scaling the resolution down, e.g. <code>3840 / 2 = 1920</code>, but as we've seen in the previous section, it's not true because the virtual resolution did not change!</p>\n<p>So let's put things together in the <code>xrandr</code> command now.</p>\n<h2>Putting Everything In An <code>xrandr</code> Command - Single Display</h2>\n<p>Let's look at the single display case: <br>\n(Note that a lot of these arguments are not necessary in the single display case, as <code>--auto</code> can infer the correct value for you. You just need to supply <code>--output</code> and <code>--scale</code>)</p>\n<pre><code>xrandr \\\n  --output DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE \\\n  --primary \\\n  --rotate normal \\\n  --mode 3840x2160 \\\n  --fb 5760x3240   \\\n  --scale 1.5x1.5 \\\n  --panning 5760x3240+0+0 \\\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>--output</code>: The device id of your monitor, you can get them by looking at the output of <code>xrandr -q</code><br>\n<code>--primary</code>: Set this as your primary display, redundant for single display.<br>\n<code>--rotate normal</code>: Set your display's rotation. Normal in this case. You can do <code>left</code> <code>right</code> etc.<br>\n<code>--mode</code>: This is the <strong>physical resolution</strong> of your display.<br>\n<code>--fb</code>: This is the <strong>virtual resolution</strong> we have talked about.<br>\n<code>--scale</code>: This is the denominator needed to bring the virtual resolution down to the physical resolution, as explained earlier.<br>\n<code>--panning</code>: For a single display, this is usually redundant. This is the virtual resolution 'taken up' by the display, plus any shift needed (starting from the top-left).</p>\n<h2>Putting Everything In An <code>xrandr</code> Command - Multiple Display</h2>\n<p>This is where things get interesting.</p>\n<pre><code>xrandr \\\n  --output DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE \\\n  --primary \\\n  --mode 3840x2160 \\\n  --fb 9000x5760 \\\n  --rotate normal \\\n  --scale 1.5x1.5 \\\n  --panning 5760x3240+0+0 \\\n\\\n  --output DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE \\\n  --rotate right \\\n  --mode 3840x2160 \\\n  --right-of DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE \\\n  --fb 9000x5760   \\\n  --scale 1.5x1.5 \\\n  --panning 3240x5760+5760+0 \\\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have 2 displays, 1 primary and another secondary on the right. Let's look at the interesting new arguments:</p>\n<p>First, the physical arrangement of the display:<br>\n<code>--rotate right</code>: Self-explanatory, it's a display in portrait mode, rotated right.<br>\n<code>--right-of DP-4-OR-WHATEVER-DISPLAY-DEVICE</code>: This display is to the right of the other monitor.</p>\n<p>Here's how it looks like:</p>\n<pre><code> ---------------  -------\n |  Display 1  |  |  2  |\n |             |  |     |\n ---------------  |     |\n                  |     |\n                  -------\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>--fb 9000x5760</code>: This is a little interesting, it's actually the <strong>virtual resolution of both displays combined</strong>, in a rectangle.<br>\nSince the horizontal virtual resolution of Display 1 is 5760, and the horizontal virtual resolution of Display 2 is 3240, thus the total horizontal resolution is <code>5760 + 3240 = 9000</code>.<br>\nFor the vertical resolution, it is bounded by Display 2's vertical resolution of <code>5760</code>.<br>\n<br>\nNote that we set the same <code>fb</code> value for both displays. Note also that this value highly depends on how you arrange your monitors.</p>\n<p><code>--panning</code>: In Display 2's case, we need to <strong><em>shift</em></strong> our display rightward, by the number of horizontal virtual pixels of Display 1, <code>5760</code> in this case. Note this also depends on how you arrange your monitors.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Fix Fractional Scaling In Linux - Or, How To Be Good At xrandr"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/entry/how-to-xrandr"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
