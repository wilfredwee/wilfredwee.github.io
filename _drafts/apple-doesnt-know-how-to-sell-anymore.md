# Apple Doesn't Know How to Sell Anymore
TL;DR? Jump to [Conclusion.](#Conclusion)

About a week back, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 with the usual keynote which was conveniently live streamed and available to watch online, cross platform.

Watching the keynote made me very frustrated. As someone who watched almost all of Steve Jobs' keynotes and interviews, something was missing. It felt like Apple was just another Samsung, HTC, Sony introducing their shiny new phone. Make no mistake, I was pretty impressed with the phone, unlike many others who felt that Apple doesn't innovate anymore. (I might have a separate blog post on why Apple is still one of the most innovative tech companies out there.)

No, it was the keynote itself. It's how they presented the phone. How they're trying to *sell* the phone. In essence, I feel that when people say 'Apple is not the same without Steve Jobs', while they usually blame the lack of innovation, I'd say the true reason is that they are not 'sold' anymore. In other words, Apple's marketing is no longer effective on many people. And the marketing department that's failing most is the one in charge of Apple's keynote addresses.

If I can sum the iPhone 7 keynote up into 1 word, it's ***sloppy***.

To make my point, I'll go through how Tim Cook and Phil Schiller sold the iPhone 7, and contrast it with how I think Jobs would have sold it, or at least would be enough of an influence to make the executives at Apple not sell it so sloppily. I will bring up examples from Jobs' keynote address, as well as keynote address from Apple executives when Jobs was still running Apple. 
 
 You can watch the keynote yourself through the VOD uploaded by Apple [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS0txu_Kzl8).

 ## Initial introduction
 Cook literally went from talking about the various features of iOS 10 straight to iPhone 7, hiding behind a shadow, on a slide. Now I understand that iPhone 7's design is not much different from the 6/6S, but that has never stopped Apple in the past to sell the heck out of it.

 It's very unusual for Apple to sell a new iPhone without talking up the previous iPhone, so that the audience has a *baseline of comparison*. Watch the [iPhone 3G keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7fVWjgxRwk), [iPhone 3GS keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2RuEuAuloA), [iPhone 4 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__jxoczNWc). [4S keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSJqPul24DI). The list can go on. Notice how they always talk about how the iPhone changed the world? The best phone ever? This is a classic marketing technique, you talk about how great your product is, and tell your customers that you've created something even better. Imagine how much better your life will be if the best thing *ever* is now going to be even better! 
 
 This is a theme that will be repeated throughout the blog post, of how Jobs doesn't just tell how his new product is the best, most innovative, most powerful, coolest thing ever. These are the things that Samsung, HTC, Sony does. No, he tells a compelling story of why his product is *better*.

 Ok, now let's go back to the iPhone 7 keynote. Right after briefly introducing the new iPhone, Cook then lets Johnny Ive work his magic through his British accent in a video detailing the iPhone's manufacturing process. I have no problems with this.

 Then, it's Schiller's turn to tell us 10 things about the iPhone.

## 1 - Design
Given that the 7 is very similar to 6S in design, I like how Schiller went ahead and focused the selling on the new Black and Jet Black colors. Overall, I have nothing negative to say about this part. Classic Apple selling.

## 2 - Home Button
Ok, first I'll list the things that I do like. 1. I like the setting up of telling the audience how important the Home Button is. 2. I like the subsequent setting up by relating it to the click wheel and Force Touch trackpad.

Ok Schiller, you got my attention. The Home Button is god damn important, and it's about to change. What new thing are you gonna sell me?

Taptic Engine!

Uh, what??

Schiller literally just lists out all the things that the Taptic Engine can do, that is *totally unrelated* to the Home Button like Ringtones, Notifications etc. and moves on.

Here's how I think Jobs would've sold it. 

1. He would do a set up similar to Schiller, getting the audience excited about the new Home Button. 
2. Then he'll reveal the new Home Button, explaining how it works briefly, Taptic Engine and what not.
3. And here's the important part, he'll sell the hell out of the new Home Button. It may go something like this:

> Now, we at Apple don't take Home Button lightly. It is the button that iPhone users rely on every day since the very first iPhone. They absolutely love the physical feel of the button, giving them instant feedback. You look at other phones, and they have these capacitive buttons, that at best, they cause the entire phone to vibrate when you press them. That just feels cheap. It's nothing like the reassuring press of the iPhone's physical Home Button.
<br /><br />
Now, the new Taptic Engine, as you may have experience through the Macbook's Force Touch Trackpad, allows you to click on the button and *feels* as if you just clicked a real, physical button.
<br /><br />
The new Home Button is really the best of both worlds! You get the satisfying press of a physical button, but you don't get the wear and tear of a physical button. You get to customize how hard to press the button to register a press, and with the new Taptic Engine, developers can now customize the experience of the new Home Button.
<br /><br />
You just have to feel it for yourself to truly appreciate it.

See how Jobs always compares the new product to either the competitors' inferior solution or the previous generation's solution? Then he'll always make a compelling case of why it's better. That's how Jobs sells you a product.

## 3 - Water and Dust Resistance
I don't have much problem with how Schiller sold this, but I personally feel that it's an insignificant enough of a change that should probably be left out or relegated to a list of 'other features'. But overall, meh.

## 4 - Camera
Compare how Schiller sells the 7's camera, to [how Jobs sells the 4's camera.](https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=1309)

Schiller's presentation is filled with technical mumbo jumbo, of how the thing works. Those are okay, and it's something that Jobs/Apple does regularly. But what's missing is a *story*. Notice how Jobs literally tells his audience what phone users *actually want*, and then proceeds to tell them how the iPhone gives them all that. All Schiller does is show the audience how great the camera is. **Sloppy.**

## 5 - Telephoto Lens
The twist with the 7S telephoto lens didn't have the same punch as the [iPhone's original reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qPAY9JqE4) either. But that was one of the best 'performance' in tech history, I can't really hold Schiller or any of today's Apple to that level.

## 6 - Speakers
Stereo speakers are probably not big enough of a feature to stand on its own, should probably just lump it with #3.

But even if it is, it's sold on stage like it's not really that important to begin with.

## 7 - No More 3.5mm Jack
First of all, I'd like to say that if Jobs was still in charge, the 3.5mm jack wouldn't be replaced by Lightning at its current state. But that's beside the point.

The point is... Jobs will never give such a lame excuse as 'Courage'.

Again, Jobs will sell the hell out of why the new solution is better, especially when it's going to be controversial. He will give specific examples of scenarios where on one hand, an iPhone with a headphone jack, and on the other, the much much better iPhone experience without a headphone jack.

Don't take my word for it, let Jobs [sell you why the DVD Drive is not needed in the Macbook Air.](https://youtu.be/1CgAKBf4bbU?t=3675) 

## 8 - AirPods
Schiller talks of all the perils of existing wireless headphones in vague terms, and then introduces the AirPods without explicitly saying how these new fancy toys solves all the problems he listed.

What Jobs would do is just list out all the wireless headphones that suck and are in the market currently (perhaps difficult, considering Apple owns Beats). And then Jobs will list out specfic features of AirPods that make it look like the best, most innovative wireless headphones ever.

Again, don't take my word for it. Watch for yourself how Jobs [rips apart the competitors' keyboards.](https://youtu.be/x7qPAY9JqE4?t=290)

## 9 - Apple Pay
Not much to talk about here without sounding like a broken record.

## 10 - Performance
Schiller just goes ahead and talks about how amazing the technology is. He misses 1 key step: Why does it matter?

Why does it matter that performance is so much better? Why does it matter it now has 2x2 cores?

Jobs would've used this opportunity to relate to the audience by stating what everyone is thinking, though not exactly. Instead of saying that the iPhone's battery is not good enough (even compared to its competitors), he'll probably talk about how people rely on their iPhones throughout the day, and it's critical to have it last etc.

Then, he'll present the solution: The 2 low-power core.

It's just small things like this that really hooks in the audience and makes them *believe* that all these new stuff are not only good and new, but something **worth paying for**.

## [Conclusion](#Conclusion)
Apple's keynotes have been very sloppy lately, and they've never really picked up the essence of Jobs' skill in convincing the audience that his new product is worth paying for. Some of the main principles that Jobs used but is absent or poorly done in today's Apple includes:
* Always compare your new product to old ones and the competitors. And make a compelling case of why it is *better*, not just the most technologically advanced, most innovative, best thing ever.
* Relate to the audience of tangible things that they do when interacting with your product.
* Never make lame excuses.

Obviously, there are other traits that Jobs possessed which made him such an admired persona. He has a natural ability to gain authority from the audience and command attention from them. He has a natural sense of humor on stage. The list goes on. But IMO, you don't have to *be* like Steve Jobs to *sell* like Steve Jobs. And this post is not about bashing Tim Cook and Phil Schiller for lacking the charisma of Steve Jobs, rather it's a critic of how little attention is paid to making the keynote truly great, something of a long Apple tradition.
